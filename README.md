# Face Detection System in JavaScript

This is a lightweight face detection system built purely with JavaScript and the Canvas API, without any external libraries or dependencies. The system uses the user's webcam to detect and track facial features in real-time.

## Features

- **Webcam integration**: Directly accesses the user's webcam to capture live video feed.
- **Skin color detection**: Identifies skin tones to help locate the face in the image.
- **Face roundness detection**: Determines the shape of the face for more accurate detection.
- **Facial feature recognition**: Detects key facial features like eyes, eyebrows, and mouth.
- **No external dependencies**: The system is built purely using native JavaScript and the Canvas API.
